# Blacklist
Built a web interface for managing phone number blacklists in Asterisk systems.
Users can create, view, and delete multiple blacklist lists, as well as check if a number exists in any list. 
The system supports bulk operations like importing or removing numbers via file upload. 
It simplifies blacklist management and enhances control over unwanted or restricted calls in telephony setups.
